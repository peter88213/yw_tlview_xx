## How to install the language pack

## Download and install

### Default: Executable Python zip archive

Download the installation package [tlviewer_xx.pyzw](https://github.com/peter88213/tlviewer_xx/raw/main/tlviewer_xx.pyzw)

- Launch *tlviewer_xx.pyzw* by double-clicking (Windows/Linux desktop),
- or execute `python tlviewer_xx.pyzw` (Windows), resp. `python3 tlviewer_xx.pyzw` (Linux) on the command line.

#### Important

Many web browsers recognize the download as an executable file and offer to open it immediately. 
This starts the installation.

However, depending on your security settings, your browser may 
initially  refuse  to download the executable file. 
In this case, your confirmation or an additional action is required. 
If this is not possible, you have the option of downloading 
the zip file. 


### Alternative: Zip file

The package is also available in zip format: [tlviewer_xx.zip](https://github.com/peter88213/tlviewer_xx/raw/main/tlviewer_xx.zip)

- Extract the content of the downloaded zipfile "tlviewer_xx.zip" into an empty folder.

## How to create/update the language pack

1. Check/edit the entries in the `tools/settings.py` file.
1. Make sure you have got a recent `messages.pot` file for each program.
2. Run the `tools/set_up.py` script to create or update the `xx.po` message catalogs.
3. Edit the `xx.po` message catalogs in the `programs` subfolders.
4. Run the `tools/build_release.py` script to create the zipfile for distribution.


### Editing a message catalog

A "message catalog" is a dictionary for the program's messages and menu entries. The file name is `xx.po`.

Be sure to use a text editor that writes utf-8 encoded text. Otherwise, it may not work with non-ASCII characters used in your language.

The  `xx.po` dictionary is organized as a set of *message ID (msgid)* - *message string (msgstr)* pairs, where *msgid* means the English term, and *msgstr* means the translated term. This is an example for such a pair where the message string is still missing:

```
msgid "Cannot overwrite file"
msgstr ""
```

Just enter all missing message strings. 
- If a message ID contains placeholders like `{}`, be sure to put them also into the message string.  
- If a message ID starts with `!`, the message string must also start with `!`.
